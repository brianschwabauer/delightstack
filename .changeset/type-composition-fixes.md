Type-level fixes so consumer apps typecheck cleanly: the database schema's `Table` constraint no longer degenerates into an impossible `table_definition` union when a field generator's shape is `any`, and `StringFieldInputType` now matches the runtime (`tel` / `datetime-local` instead of `phone` / `datetime`); stripe's `PlanDefinition.entitlements` accepts `readonly string[]`; the images and ai request handles and utilities' `createDevHandle` are now generic over the event so they compose with SvelteKit's `Handle` without casts; the editor package no longer emits an `Editor` component export shadowed by the `Editor` class type (which made the component import type-only for consumers).
