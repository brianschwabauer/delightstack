## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 12d7e4b: Fix low-contrast action-colored text and icons (most visibly in dark mode) when the brand seed is dark. `--color-action` is a _surface_ token — its lightness is clamped to a mid band (dark 0.4–0.6) so it reads as a fill under `--color-action-text`. Several components were using it directly as a **foreground** color on the neutral page/card background, which only stays legible when the seed happens to be light: the default `#10a6c4` seed squeaks past AA at ~4.9:1, but a dark seed lands at the clamp floor and drops to ~2:1 (failing WCAG AA).

  New semantic tokens `--color-action-fg` / `--color-accent-fg` (styles) provide a lightness-lifted foreground — the same lift the outline `Button` already applies to its own text — so accent text/icons stay ≥4.5:1 regardless of how dark `--color-primary` is. Components now use them wherever action/accent is text or an icon on a neutral surface: `Tabs` (active label + underline indicator), `Callout` (icon/title/dismiss/accent-bar, via a derived `--callout-fg`), `Stat`, `Code`, `PDF`, `Table` (pending status), `Fieldset` (hover), `FileUpload` (browse link), and `Toast` (info/loading). Paired backgrounds, borders, and focus rings still use `--color-action` unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 0549bda: Press (`:active`) effects on large, full-width elements (Table rows, ListItems, Tree rows, Accordion headers, CommandPalette items, Select options) now use a two-axis scale instead of a uniform ratio: horizontally the element gives up a fixed `--press-shrink` (new token, default 20px) of width no matter how wide it is — computed as `1 - tan(atan2(var(--press-shrink), 100cqi))` — so a full-page row's edges never pull in by ~9% of a huge width; vertically it squashes by `--press-scale-y` (new token, default 0.85), which is what makes the press read as a press. All of these also share a consistent 2px downward nudge. Small controls (Button, chips, Tabs, Checkbox, etc.) are unchanged. Table's drag-lift start scale mirrors the new formula from the scroller width. Accordion headers now also play the standard ripple on click, matching ListItem/Button.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8420739: First stable release (1.0.0). The DelightStack packages now version together at a coordinated, stable 1.0. This bump declares the public API of each package stable; individual packages may not have changed since their previous release.
