## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 2dc1c9c: Selected Button and focused field contrast:

  - Selected (`active`) outline and transparent Buttons get their own, deeper wash instead of sharing the hover tint. They no longer look merely hovered in a ButtonGroup, and they stay visible with a dark brand color in dark mode. Hovering a selected button no longer fades it back to the hover tint.
  - Icon-only end buttons in an attached ButtonGroup split their extra width across both sides (slightly more on the rounded end), so the icon sits centered in its segment instead of being pushed toward the group's middle.
  - Input and Select draw their focus border and floated label in `--color-action-fg` instead of `--color-action`, so focusing a field brightens it in dark mode rather than dimming it.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 12d7e4b: Fix low-contrast action-colored text and icons (most visibly in dark mode) when the brand seed is dark. `--color-action` is a _surface_ token — its lightness is clamped to a mid band (dark 0.4–0.6) so it reads as a fill under `--color-action-text`. Several components were using it directly as a **foreground** color on the neutral page/card background, which only stays legible when the seed happens to be light: the default `#10a6c4` seed squeaks past AA at ~4.9:1, but a dark seed lands at the clamp floor and drops to ~2:1 (failing WCAG AA).

  New semantic tokens `--color-action-fg` / `--color-accent-fg` (styles) provide a lightness-lifted foreground — the same lift the outline `Button` already applies to its own text — so accent text/icons stay ≥4.5:1 regardless of how dark `--color-primary` is. Components now use them wherever action/accent is text or an icon on a neutral surface: `Tabs` (active label + underline indicator), `Callout` (icon/title/dismiss/accent-bar, via a derived `--callout-fg`), `Stat`, `Code`, `PDF`, `Table` (pending status), `Fieldset` (hover), `FileUpload` (browse link), and `Toast` (info/loading). Paired backgrounds, borders, and focus rings still use `--color-action` unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 0549bda: Press (`:active`) effects on large, full-width elements (Table rows, ListItems, Tree rows, Accordion headers, CommandPalette items, Select options) now use a two-axis scale instead of a uniform ratio: horizontally the element gives up a fixed `--press-shrink` (new token, default 20px) of width no matter how wide it is — computed as `1 - tan(atan2(var(--press-shrink), 100cqi))` — so a full-page row's edges never pull in by ~9% of a huge width; vertically it squashes by `--press-scale-y` (new token, default 0.85), which is what makes the press read as a press. All of these also share a consistent 2px downward nudge. Small controls (Button, chips, Tabs, Checkbox, etc.) are unchanged. Table's drag-lift start scale mirrors the new formula from the scroller width. Accordion headers now also play the standard ripple on click, matching ListItem/Button.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8420739: First stable release (1.0.0). The DelightStack packages now version together at a coordinated, stable 1.0. This bump declares the public API of each package stable; individual packages may not have changed since their previous release.
